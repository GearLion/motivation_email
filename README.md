# Motivation Quotation
The goal is to send out motivation emails every Monday (or Sunday night) to give subscribers a boost in the morning. Currently the app picks a quotation from the list provided (must hardcode from the two available) and sends it to the single email provided.

## Future Functionality
* Pick a list at random (from future lists, e.g. 'money', 'fame', 'love', 'discipline', etc.)
* Name that quotation's subject in the line of the email
* Pick a quotation from that list randomly
* Send that quotation to all emails within a separate list
* Keep and update that email list automatically
